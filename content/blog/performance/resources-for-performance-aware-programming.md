Performance aware programming is a term coined by Casey Muratori. It is also a series of videos by Casey. In it, he
describes how to become aware of performance in your programs. And to reason about how performant our programs could be
when we are aware of a computer's workings. In this post I keep track resources I study to learn more about
performant programming.
