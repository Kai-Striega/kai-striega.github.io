      <description>Block Quotes# Block quotes consist of indented body elements:&#xA;My theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.&#xA;&amp;mdash;Anne Elk (Miss)</description>

      <description>This is quite important, for a website where the majority of the content is going to be prose.&#xA;Notice the font family being used for the prose, as well as the font family being used for the heading. Think about the spacing between the lines, as well as the spacing between various paragraphs. Also keep the font weight in mind, and consider if/how you want antialiasing and font-smoothing to work.</description>
